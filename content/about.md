# About me

My name is Kakeami.
As you can see from my account name, I love manga ("Kakeami" is a traditional technique used in Japanese manga).
I seriously wanted to be a manga artist until I was in the third year of junior high school, but I gave up because I didn't have the guts and sense to draw even an 18-page short story, [let alone 45 pages](https://shonenjumpplus.com/episode/3269754496401369355).

I'm now a cog in the wheel of society as a company employee.
I am a father of two children.
As a hobby, I am studying Computer Science at [OMSCS, Georgia Institute of Technology](https://omscs.gatech.edu/).
My dream is to go on a graduation trip with my family to the U.S. when I get my master's degree (social and financial situations permitting).

# About this

I'm going to write some trivial technical notes that are not worth submitting on [Zenn](https://zenn.dev/) or [Qiita](https://qiita.com/).
However, I may also write about things that have nothing to do with technology, such as my vegetable garden, cooking, and reading.
